The dataset contains information on all the teams that have participated in all the past tournaments. It has data about how many baskets each team scored, conceded, how many times they came within the first 2 positions, how many tournaments they have qualified, their best position in the past, etc.\n### DATA DESCRIPTION: \nBasketball.csv - The data set contains information on all the teams so far participated in all the past tournaments.\n### DATA DICTIONARY:\n1. Team: Team’s name\n2. Tournament: Number of played tournaments.\n3. Score: Team’s score so far.\n4. PlayedGames: Games played by the team so far.\n5. WonGames: Games won by the team so far.\n6. DrawnGames: Games drawn by the team so far.\n7. LostGames: Games lost by the team so far.\n8. BasketScored: Basket scored by the team so far.\n9. BasketGiven: Basket scored against the team so far.\n10. TournamentChampion: How many times the team was a champion of the tournaments so far.\n11. Runner-up: How many times the team was a runners-up of the tournaments so far.\n12. TeamLaunch: Year the team was launched on professional basketball.\n13. HighestPositionHeld: Highest position held by the team amongst all the tournaments played.\n\n### PROJECT OBJECTIVE:\nCompany’s management wants to invest on proposals on managing some of the best teams in the league. The analytics department has been assigned with a task of creating a report on the performance shown by the teams. Some of the older teams are already in contract with competitors. Hence Company X wants to understand which teams they can approach which will be a deal win for them.\n\n## 1.)
